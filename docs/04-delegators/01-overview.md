# Delegators Overview

## Introduction

Delegators are individuals or entities that participates in the network's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism by delegating RIO or RST tokens to a validator node.

This delegation process involves entrusting a validator with the responsibility of securing the network, validating transactions, and creating new blocks. Delegators, in return, receive RIO rewards for staking their assets and supporting the network's operations.

Delegators have the flexibility to choose which validator node they want to delegate their assets to.
