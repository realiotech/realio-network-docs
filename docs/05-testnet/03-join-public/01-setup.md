# Setup

:::note Current Testnet  
See the [testnet repo](https://github.com/realiotech/testnets) for information on the latest testnet,
including the correct version of realio-networkd to use and details about the genesis file.  
:::

## Validators
:::warning Requires realio-networkd executable  
To join the public testnet you **must** have [`realio-networkd` installed](/fullnode/setup).  
:::

To become a testnet validator, these instructions apply:

1. [Create a full node](/fullnode/setup)
2. [Become a validator](/validators/setup)

The only difference is the realio-networkd software version and genesis file. See the [testnet repo](https://github.com/realiotech/testnets) for information on testnets, including the correct version of realio-networkd to use and details about the genesis file.
